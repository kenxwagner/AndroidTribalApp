  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Tribal affairs are governed by an elected body called the Board of Trustees.  A chairman presides over the Board, which consists of eight other members.  The Board sets policy, makes the final decisions on tribal affairs, and takes a lead role in determining priority projects and issues.  The Board conducts business meetings weekly, in addition to numerous work sessions with staff and special board meetings with external individuals and organizations. All of the board members, except the Chair, participate in various commissions and committees established to oversee specific tribal issues, such as education, natural resources, water, health and welfare, cultural resources, fish and wildlife, law and order, and more.</p>
<p>
The Board is elected by the General Council, which consists of all Tribal members age 18 and older.   The General Council also elects its own officers.  The General Council meets monthly to hear updates from its Chairman, the Board of Trustees, and various working groups.  This is also an opportunity for General Council members to provide input and recommendations to the tribal officials.  Special General Council meetings are occasionally held to discuss specific issues.

The day-to-day work of the Confederated Tribes government is carried out by a staff of nearly 500 employees (47% are our own tribal members, 14% are Indians from other tribes, and 38% are non-Indians). The Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director are responsible for directing the staff, which is organized into several departments and programs.</p>
